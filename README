Check-Plus: An EDSL for writing Check tests.

Check [1] is an excellent framework for unit testing C code. This project,
Check-plus, extends Check by providing a declarative syntax for defining tests,
that aims to let you repeat yourself as little as possible.

See the doc/ directory for examples of usage. You'll probably want to read the
Check Manual [2], if you're unfamiliar with Check, first.
